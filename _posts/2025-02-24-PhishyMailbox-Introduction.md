## Phishing research is dead. Long live Phishing Research

Hey friend. Since you're reading this blog, you're probably interested in phishing. You know, the thing that more than 90% of cyber attacks use to gain access to systems. The bad emails containing links your IT department doesn't want you to click. Or the malicious excel files that download malware on your computer (ok, all excel-files are somewhat malicious, but these ones especially so). We all know, *phishing is a problem*. But what many outside the phishing research community don't know: *phishing research also is a problem*.

Why, you may ask. Let me give you the quick and dirty history of phishing research. Phishing is now a quarter decade old. Academic research about phishing started in the early 2000s, when people found the phenomenon to become more pervasive, and the internet was adopted more heavily. Soon enough, researchers started sending out phishing emails to (at the time involuntary) participants themselves to see whether they can gain some knowledge from that. Turns out, they couldn't get much. Yes, some emails with specific wording or social cues were clicked more often - and that's where people still draw advice from ("if they say it's urgent, be suspicious"), but other than that such research can not tell you much about other factors influencing the decision to click on a link in a phishing email. Personality traits, external circumstances or even specific elements in phishing emails could not be researched with such large campaign studies. Researchers then adopted what is called scenario-based (or role-play) study design. It usually entails that a participant gets to either view an image of an email or a locked-down inbox with an email, immerse themselves in the situation of a made-up office or work environment, and has to decide whether it is phishing or not. In some cases they have to evaluate it with some different trust measure. While this enables you to indeed inquire about other constructs or effects influencing phishing detection, they have some problems of themselves. And to be honest, they're not hard to spot. Take a second and think about potential pitfalls with such designs. 

Yes, you guessed correctly. It's the environment. And that people tell you to look for phishing emails. Both are kind of bad things when it comes to research that concerns issues that happen in real life, often, and with a lot of noise. Because you have to think about the goal: Research wants to be applicable to real problems - ideally. But these scenarios are the best we have so far, the researchers thought, and nobody thought of bettering the situation somehow. Maybe they all had something else to do, dishes or peer review, or flying to conferences. Who knows. In any case, my colleagues and I thought about different solutions to this problem, and we stumbled upon a conundrum: The phishing campaign studies were always simulating the problem, being the emails themselves. But this approach in the same manner limited their ability to gain insight into the problem. It's like wanting to cut the hair at the back of your head while also observing results. Kind of impossible. Unless you put up a big stack of mirrors. 

And that's what we did. We simulated the environment instead of the problem, or, in other words: We built an app. This app is called PhishyMailbox. It looks and feels like a generic webmail client, one you could find for example with Outlook - just a bit different. It is built for researchers and practitioners and allows you to insert emails into a simulated inbox. These emails then can be viewed and interacted with by users just like you could view and interact with emails in your inbox, just you can't answer them. If you click on a link, it will forward you to an "Error 404" page.
