# Welcome!

Hi! You have reached the blog of Oliver D. Reithmaier (k4tana). While I do list my sources, my posts about science are mostly not covered in citations. There's a reason for this: Scientists deserve reasonable doubt. Even if I cite someone or something, it need not be true. It is up to you to verify what I'm saying holds up.
