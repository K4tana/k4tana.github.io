Hi! This is the blog of Oliver D. Reithmaier (k4tana). Feel free to browse around! 

**Disclaimer:** While I do list my sources, my posts about science mostly don't use in-text citations. There's a reason for this: Scientists deserve (reasonable) doubt. Even if I cite someone or something, it need not be true. It is up to the reader to verify what I'm saying holds up.
