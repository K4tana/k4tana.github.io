# About Me

I'm Oliver D. Reithmaier, a half-brit German scientist in the usable security field. I speak English, German, (bad) Japanese and can read Dutch (dont test me to speak it, please). 

Here's some quick facts about myself:
- Bachelor's in Psychology (LMU Munich)
- Master's in Social/IO Psychology (LMU Munich)
- Currently PhD Candidate at the Usable Security & Privacy Group at Leibniz University Hannover (Germany)


My work focuses much around phishing emails, research methods and cybersecurity science concepts that stem from psychology (e.g. self-efficacy). Current research projects include: 

- Self-efficacy theory and knowledge in cybersecurity
- Developing phishing detection ability tests with item response theory
- Further development of the PhishyMailbox toolkit

In my free time I enjoy gardening, gaming, music, building things and, lately, doing fun DIY projects with microelectronics.
